  - deuzi says: Hello.  Welcome to study hall.
  - deuzi says: My name is Marco and I am here to help you review for your geometry test.
  
review:
  - deuzi says: Which would you like to review?
  - choice:
    - 1.5 Overview Of Angles:
    - 1.7 Midpoint, Endpoint and Length:
    - 1.8 Perimeter and Areas:
  
1.5 Overview Of Angles:
  - deuzi says: Here are a few things you should know about angles.
  - deuzi says: An angle is a measure of rotation.
  - deuzi says: Angles are measured in degrees.
  - deuzi says: There are 360 degrees in a circle.  If you look at a navigation compass, which is diferent from the drawing compass you use in class, you will see 360 degrees on it.
  - show navcompass:
  - deuzi says: If you divide a circle in half you get a semicirlce which has 180 degrees, like on your protractor.
  - show protractor:
  - deuzi says: If you divide a semicirlce in half you get a quarter circle.  Notice that at the top of your protractor is the number 90.  A 90 degree angle is also known as a right angle.  
  - hide navcompass:
  - hide protractor:
  - show intersecingangles:
  - deuzi says: Angles are formed when lines intersect like in this diagram.
  - deuzi says: There are certain properties of angles that you should know.
  - hide intersectingangles:
  - show adjacentangles:
  - deuzi says: Adjacent angles are angles that are next to each other.  They share a common side but do not overlap.
  - hide adjacentangles:
  - show congruentangles:
  - deuzi says: Congruent angles have the same measurement.
  - hide congruentangles:
  - show complimentaryangles:
  - deuzi says: Complimentary angles are angles that add up to 90 degrees.  
  - hide complimentaryangles:
  - show supplementaryangles:
  - deuzi says: Supplementary angles are angles that add up to 180 degrees.
  - hide supplementaryangles:
  - show linearpair:
  - deuzi says: If two angles are suplementary and congruent they make up a linear pair.
  - hide linearpair:
  - show verticalangles:
  - deuzi says: When two lines intersect they form two pair of vertical angles, aka opposite angles.  vertical angles are congruent.  The rays of two vertical anlges are opposite (pointing away at 180 degrees).
  # - show opposite angle.
  - hide verticalangles:
  - show linesandangles:
  - deuzi says: Here is a summary diagram of information about angles.  Take a minute to review it before continuing.
  - hide linesandangles:
  - deuzi says: One other concept is bisecting angles.
  - show anglebisector:
  - deuzi says: If a ray bisects an angle it cuts the angle in half.  The two new angles are adjacent and congruent.  They are also 1/2 the size of the original angle.

quiz1_5:
  - deuzi says: Okay.  Let's go through the section 1.5 quiz questions.
  - show quiz1_5diagram1:
  - deuzi says: Use the diagram for next several question.  I will use the "<" symbol to stand for "angle".  I might name angles using a number like <2 or by using its points like <SOT.
  - deuzi says: I will also use "->" to stand for "ray".  So "->OR" is ray OR.
  - deuzi Name an angle adjacent to <5?

    - <1:
      - show deuzi: angry
      - show linesandangles:

      - show deuzi: happy
      - deuzi says: Yes!  <TOY is supplementary to <5!  Their measures add to 180.  <SOZ is also supplementary to <5.  We know this because <2 and <5 are congruent (vertical angles) and <SOZ is supplementary to <2.

    - <XOZ:
      - show deuzi: angry
      - show linesandangles:
      - deuzi says: That is not right.  To be linear angles must be both supplementary and adjacent.  <XOZ is neither.

  - choice:
    - <1:
      - show deuzi: angry

      - duezi says: Yes!  That's the answer I am looking for!  Note that <5 is congruent also because it is a vertical and <6 is congruent as the adjacent angle to <5.  But <3 is the best answer.
